# Tristan St-Cyr's Resume
Tired of having to deal with non-standard file formats and frustrating formatting in word processors for my resumes, I decided to implement it in HTML using [mustache.js](http://mustache.github.io/). Works great!

The resume can bee seen [here](https://tristanstcyr.github.io/resume/).
